Note that <code>grid_rf</code> was trained as follows:</p>\r\n","<pre><code>grid_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n","</code></pre></div>"],"metadata":{"id":"fd9TmPeTIdCu"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lnunesAI/Datacamp/main/2-machine-learning-scientist-with-python/04-machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python/datasets/bikes.csv')\r\n","X = df.drop('cnt', axis='columns')\r\n","y = df['cnt']\r\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1111)\r\n","\r\n","grid_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Fitting 3 folds for each of 27 candidates, totalling 81 fits\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Using backend LokyBackend with 2 concurrent workers.\n","[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done  46 tasks      | elapsed:   29.4s\n","[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done  81 out of  81 | elapsed:   48.4s finished\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["GridSearchCV(cv=3, error_score=nan,\n","             estimator=RandomForestRegressor(bootstrap=True, ccp_alpha=0.0,\n","                                             criterion='mse', max_depth=None,\n","                                             max_features='auto',\n","                                             max_leaf_nodes=None,\n","                                             max_samples=None,\n","                                             min_impurity_decrease=0.0,\n","                                             min_impurity_split=None,\n","                                             min_samples_leaf=1,\n","                                             min_samples_split=2,\n","                                             min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,\n","                                             n_estimators=10, n_jobs=-1,\n","                                             oob_score=False, random_state=2,\n","                                             verbose=0, warm_start=False),\n","             iid='deprecated', n_jobs=-1,\n","             param_grid={'max_features': ['log2', 'auto', 'sqrt'],\n","                         'min_samples_leaf': [2, 10, 30],\n","                         'n_estimators': [100, 350, 500]},\n","             pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', refit=True, return_train_score=False,\n","             scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', verbose=1)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":29}],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BObrSbn_IVzP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612393997596,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":49481,"user":{"displayName":"Lucas Nunes","photoUrl":"","userId":"13884079641685385195"}},"outputId":"a519de33-5e99-44e6-c744-a1a9ddce2c60"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Instructions\r\n","<ul>\r\n","<li><p>Import <code>mean_squared_error</code> as <code>MSE</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>. </p></li>\r\n","<li><p>Extract the best estimator from <code>grid_rf</code> and assign it to <code>best_model</code>. </p></li>\r\n","<li><p>Predict <code>best_model</code>'s test set labels and assign the result to <code>y_pred</code>.</p></li>\r\n","<li><p>Compute <code>best_model</code>'s test set RMSE.</p></li>\r\n","</ul>"],"metadata":{"id":"i6WXavRbIezt"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE \r\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE\r\n","\r\n","# Extract the best estimator\r\n","best_model = grid_rf.best_estimator_\r\n","\r\n","# Predict test set labels\r\n","y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)\r\n","\r\n","# Compute rmse_test\r\n","rmse_test = MSE(y_test, y_pred)**(1/2)\r\n","\r\n","\r\n","# Print rmse_test\r\n","print('Test RMSE of best model: {:.3f}'.format(rmse_test)) "],"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Test RMSE of best model: 52.882\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iYeI9OfoIg89","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612394044988,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":605,"user":{"displayName":"Lucas Nunes","photoUrl":"","userId":"13884079641685385195"}},"outputId":"ed3452a0-1c98-4077-e84b-5fa4731f4129"}}]}
